# RedM-HotAirBalloon-VORP
VORP Framework compatible Hot Air Balloon. Allows you to set a spawn coordinate that players can walk up to and purchase the Hot Air Balloon for a set price. This feature enables players to explore beautiful landscapes. The controls are difficult to master, which adds to the fun of learning and exploring. The script is Plug and Play unless spawn location and prices need to be changed, which can be done in the client and server files.

Original Script by @drmabuse19 - https://github.com/drmabuse19/RedM_AirBalloon

This script just adds VORP compatibility to purchase the Balloon instead of spawning it.

## Installation
1. Download and extract the folder into your server resource folder.
2. Make sure that the resource is ensured in your server.cfg file and that the resource has started in the server.

4. To delete the balloon, Go to <code>-1817.77, -622.36, 154.75</code> and press G to delete it.
